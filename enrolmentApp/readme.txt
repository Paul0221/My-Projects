README

This is the readme file for the Admissions System.

-- SETUP --

Before running the application, the MySQL database needs to be setup. To do this, ensure that MYSQL is downloaded onto your system. 
Then, in the MYSQL Workbench, open the file table_creation.sql and run the CREATE and INSERT INTO statements.

Once that has been setup, you can launch the application through any IDE of your preference.
To ensure it works as intended, I recommend using PyCharm as that was what was used during the course of this project.

-- Application --

Loading the application initially presents you with 2 options:

- Uploading the application
- Admin log in

To upload the application, follow the instructions presented to add your name, email, qualifications and personal statement.

For the admin log in, please contact me at sc20poo@leeds.ac.uk for me to provide this information.

Once you have logged in then you have the ability to access the view application screen or the course selection screen (the latter is only used for testing purposes).

Within the view application screen, you can view all the applications and overwrite any personal statement scores.
